v0.3.3
- Hotfix for parsing left_on and right_on

TODO: Need to figure out fix to the inversion of symbol issue. Somewhat complicated.

v0.3.2
Various PRs added fixing bugs, etc.

v0.3.1
This update is almost solely the pull requests by @bleearmstrong that were sitting
in the repo waiting. There were some minor bug-fixes and changes too.

- `select_if` and `drop_if` are now available to perform selection according to a function
- `mutate_if` allows variable creation if a criterion function is evaluated as True
- `row_number` window function is available (same as rank(method='first'))
- `distinct` can take no arguments, making it equivalent to `drop_duplicates` with no arguments

v0.3.0
Lots and lots of big changes here. Total reworking of the internal functionality.
The good news is that it should (basically) work the same as before, but
hopefully better. Obviously keep in mind that this is still beta and there will
be plenty of bugs to work out on the horizon, but the preexisting tests pass for now...
There is not backward compatibility with old versions as the decorator names
have changed, but again, the functionality is otherwise the same.

Some major things (see readme for details):
- Moved entirely to python 3 support only. It may still work in python 2, but don't count on it.
- pandas-ply is no longer required; It was brittle and so rolled my own stuff.
- Selection "subfunctions" are now working and the selection functions have been changed in light of this.


v0.2.4
- Bug fixed in semi-join and anti-join
- top_n added

v0.2.3
Inplace piping added using the `>>=` operator. The `pipe` decorator internals
have been changed to make this possible through the addition of an `__rshift__`
implementation and chaining pipes together until evaluated against a
DataFrame.


v0.2.2
- Added docstrings to functions and classes.
- Added the `case_when` function.
- Fixed `arrange` to work with symbolic functions like `desc` in the function
  call.
- Added `cumany` and `cumall` window functions.
- Added `if_else` function.
- Added `na_if` function.
- Added `percent_rank` function.
- Reorganization of decorator functions (better subclassing).


v0.2.1
Fixed an issue with the way the decorators were structured, particularly
the @make_symbolic, that would cause problems with returning Call objects
that would not evaluate properly. Hopefully this is now resolved.

The "coalesce" function was added from dplyr.

Some code was moved from base.py to the new vector.py file. The vector.py
file now contains functions that specifically perform operations on
series or numpy arrays (such as coalesce, desc, etc.). Test files have been
reorganized accordingly.


v0.2.0
This release now introduces the @make_symbolic decorator, which can wrap
functions to allow them to evaluate later. This is particularly (and perhaps
only) useful when you embed functions as arguments to other functions. For
example the summary and window functions.

The code for the symbolic handling decorators has been reworked. They now
inherit from a common class since they shared patterns in their code.

- @make_symbolic decorator
- README updates
- desc() and order_series_by() functions
- re-imagining of the code for @symbolic_evaluation, @symbolic_reference
  (the functionality remains unchanged)
- window and summary functions, along with their tests, have been moved around
  to other files.


v0.1.10
- `separate` and `unite` functions added.
- Summary functions added for series operations.
- README improved dramatically.
- Function docstrings added to more functions (still not all).

v0.1.9
Moved unit tests into individual files that reflect the categories of the
functions/features they are testing. Some small bugs have been fixed as well.

v0.1.8
The pipe decorator now copies the dataframe upon each chained function, along
with the `_grouped_by` attribute, if any. Before, operations with the pipe
functions were modifying the original dataframe (such as `mutate`).

v0.1.7
Restructuring of package to include `diamonds.csv` with pip installation
and require `six` and `pandas-ply` rather than come pre-packaged with them.

v0.1.6
Added window functions:
`dense_rank`
`min_rank`
`cumsum`
`cummean`
`cummax`
`cummin`
`cumprod`


v0.1.5
dplyr set operations added thanks to bleearmstrong.

`df >> union(other)`
Rows that appear in either `df` or `other`.

`df >> intersect(other)`
Rows that appear in both `df` and `other`

`df >> set_diff(other)`
Rows that appear in `df` but not `other`.
